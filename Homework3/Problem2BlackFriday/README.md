Two design patterns are followed here: Composite and Observer

Observer is being implemented with the BlackFridayDeals, Observer, and Customer classes. 
Customers can subscribe to BlackFridayDeals if they desire.

Composite pattern is implemented with ProductComponent (Abstract class), Product(Subject), and Category.

Black Friday deals, categories, and products are created in the Main.
